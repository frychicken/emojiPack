I divided this into 5 groups of emojis

## Extended emoji

_You don't think you need these until you see these_

When you type in ":/", it becomes :confused: 

or ":P", it becomes :stuck_out_tongue: 

or ":v", it becomes packman face; you don't like that? then the emojis above fit perfectly with what you type.

## Discord face emoji

_Memers, here you go_
